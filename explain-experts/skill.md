# Skill: Explain Through Experts

> *"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."* — Isaac Newton
>
> *"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's mind there are few."* — Shunryu Suzuki

Transform any topic into a multi-perspectival exploration through the lenses of 5 world-class thought leaders — revealing how the best minds would approach, analyze, and disagree about the subject.

## Invocation

Use this skill when:
- User asks to "explain through experts", "expert perspectives", or "what would [experts] say"
- User wants to understand how top thinkers would view a topic
- Exploring a subject from multiple authoritative angles
- Understanding where smart people disagree (and why)
- Creating content that synthesizes diverse expert viewpoints

## The Multi-Perspectival Mindset

**Why experts matter:**
Expertise is pattern recognition refined over decades. Experts don't just know more facts — they see different *structures* in the same information. By channeling multiple experts, we access multiple ways of seeing.

**Why disagreement matters:**
If all experts agreed, you'd only need one. The value of multi-perspectival analysis is revealing:
- What's genuinely contested vs. settled
- Which assumptions lead to which conclusions
- Where your own thinking might be incomplete
- The tradeoffs that aren't obvious from any single view

**The approach:**
1. **Categorize** — Identify the domain(s) the topic spans
2. **Select** — Choose 5 recently influential thought leaders across Technical, Business, and Ethics dimensions
3. **Channel** — Present each expert's likely perspective based on their known frameworks
4. **Contrast** — Highlight where they would disagree and why
5. **Synthesize** — Extract insights from the convergences and divergences

## Expert Selection Criteria

### Recently Influential
- Active and influential within the last ~10-15 years
- May include those recently deceased if their work remains highly relevant (e.g., Clayton Christensen, Daniel Kahneman)
- Should have substantial published work, talks, or documented positions to draw from

### Diverse Perspectives
Aim to cover at least 3 of these 5 angles:

| Perspective | What They Bring | Example Domains |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Technical** | How it works, what's possible, implementation realities | Engineers, scientists, researchers, builders |
| **Business** | Market dynamics, strategy, value creation, scaling | Entrepreneurs, VCs, executives, strategists |
| **Ethics** | Values, fairness, consequences, who's affected | Ethicists, activists, policy researchers |
| **Practitioner** | Real-world application, what actually happens on the ground | Operators, consultants, experienced builders |
| **Research/Academic** | Rigorous analysis, empirical evidence, theoretical frameworks | Professors, researchers, authors of seminal studies |

### Selection Process

1. **Identify the domain(s):** What field(s) does this topic touch?
2. **List candidate experts:** Who are the most influential voices in these domains?
3. **Filter for relevance:** Who has specifically addressed this topic or closely related ones?
4. **Ensure diversity:** Do the 5 experts represent different angles (technical, business, ethics)?
5. **Verify recency:** Are they recently influential with documented positions?

## Attribution Guidelines (Moderate Rigor)

### What You Can Do:
- **Quote directly** when they've said something specific and documented
- **Extrapolate from frameworks** — If someone has a known model (e.g., Christensen's disruption theory), apply it to new situations
- **Infer from patterns** — If they've consistently argued X in similar contexts, suggest they'd likely argue X here
- **Flag uncertainty** — Use phrases like "would likely argue," "based on their framework," "consistent with their view"

### What You Should Avoid:
- Putting specific words in their mouth without evidence
- Claiming certainty about positions they haven't taken
- Ignoring when their views are more nuanced than a summary allows
- Misrepresenting their actual stated positions

### Attribution Language:

| Confidence Level | Language to Use |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Direct quote/position | "[Name] has stated that..." / "[Name] argues..." |
| Strong inference | "Based on [Name]'s framework, they would likely..." |
| Reasonable extrapolation | "[Name]'s perspective suggests..." / "Consistent with [Name]'s views..." |
| Speculative | "One might imagine [Name] would ask..." |

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing an expert explanation:

- [ ] Are all 5 experts genuinely influential and recently relevant?
- [ ] Do they represent at least 3 different perspectives (technical, business, ethics, etc.)?
- [ ] Is each expert's view grounded in their actual known positions/frameworks?
- [ ] Are extrapolations flagged appropriately?
- [ ] Are disagreements clearly identified with the underlying reasons?
- [ ] Is there a synthesis that adds value beyond just listing views?
- [ ] Would each expert recognize their own perspective in your summary?

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **False balance:** Treating fringe positions as equal to mainstream expert consensus
2. **Strawmanning:** Weakening an expert's position to make another look better
3. **Recency bias:** Only selecting "hot" voices vs. deeply knowledgeable ones
4. **Homogeneity:** Picking 5 experts who basically agree (defeats the purpose)
5. **Fabrication:** Making up quotes or positions they haven't taken
6. **Celebrity over expertise:** Choosing famous people over actual domain experts
7. **Ignoring context:** Expert views often depend on context they've specified

---

## When to Combine with Other Skills

**Explain-Experts + Explain-Simple:**
After presenting expert views, add an ELI10 summary: "If you had to explain this to a smart 10-year-old..."

**Explain-Experts + Explain-Profound:**
Go deeper on the philosophical underpinnings that the experts themselves may not articulate: "Beneath these expert views lies a more fundamental question..."

The three skills form a **depth spectrum:**
- **Simple:** Accessible to anyone
- **Experts:** Authoritative and multi-perspectival
- **Profound:** First-principles and philosophical

True mastery is knowing which lens (or combination) serves the moment.

## Closing Thought

> *"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."* — F. Scott Fitzgerald

Experts disagree because reality is complex. By channeling multiple expert perspectives, we don't seek false certainty — we develop the capacity to hold multiple valid framings simultaneously.

That is not confusion. That is wisdom.
