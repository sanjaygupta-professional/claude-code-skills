# EMPOWERED Book — Simple Explanations Glossary

Quick reference for explaining EMPOWERED concepts to a smart 10-year-old.

## Core Concepts

### Empowered Teams
**Complex:** Cross-functional teams with autonomy to solve problems and accountability for outcomes.

**Simple:** A group where everyone helps decide how to solve a problem—not just follow orders. Like a group project where you pick what to build AND how to build it.

---

### Feature Teams (Mercenaries)
**Complex:** Teams that implement stakeholder-defined solutions without agency over approach or outcomes.

**Simple:** A group that just follows instructions from someone else. Like being told exactly what to draw in art class instead of using your imagination.

---

### Missionaries vs Mercenaries
**Complex:** Missionaries are intrinsically motivated by the mission; mercenaries are extrinsically motivated by compensation.

**Simple:**
- **Missionaries** love what they're building. They'd work on it even if no one told them to.
- **Mercenaries** just do what they're paid to do. They don't really care if it's great.

Think about cleaning your room: Do you do it because you WANT a nice room, or only because you'll get in trouble if you don't?

---

### Product Vision
**Complex:** A compelling, aspirational description of the future state the product aims to create.

**Simple:** A picture in your mind of the amazing thing you want to build someday—like imagining the coolest treehouse ever before you start building.

---

### Product Strategy
**Complex:** The sequence of target markets, value propositions, and key initiatives to achieve the vision.

**Simple:** Your game plan. If the vision is "win the championship," strategy is "first get really good at defense, then work on scoring."

---

### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
**Complex:** Goal-setting framework pairing qualitative objectives with quantitative key results.

**Simple:**
- **Objective** = What you want (e.g., "Get better at math")
- **Key Results** = How you'll know you're getting there (e.g., "Score 90% on the next 3 tests")

It's goals plus a scoreboard.

---

### Team Topology
**Complex:** The organizational structure of product teams including platform, experience, and enabling teams.

**Simple:** How teams are organized—like how a soccer team has defenders, midfielders, and forwards, each with different jobs but all working together.

---

### Platform Teams
**Complex:** Teams that build internal infrastructure and services used by other teams.

**Simple:** The team that builds the tools everyone else uses. Like the kids who build the stage so others can put on the play.

---

### Experience Teams
**Complex:** Teams focused on specific user journeys or customer segments.

**Simple:** Teams that make sure using the product feels good for one type of person—like making sure the playground is fun for kindergartners OR for fifth graders.

---

### Coaching
**Complex:** Developing people's competence and confidence through guidance rather than direction.

**Simple:** Helping someone get better by asking good questions and letting them figure things out—instead of just telling them the answer.

---

### Competence and Character
**Complex:** The dual criteria for hiring—skills/knowledge and integrity/collaboration.

**Simple:**
- **Competence** = Can they do the job? Do they know their stuff?
- **Character** = Are they a good person? Do they help others and tell the truth?

You need BOTH. Someone really smart but mean makes the whole team worse.

---

### Discovery
**Complex:** The process of validating that a solution is valuable, usable, feasible, and viable before building it.

**Simple:** Figuring out if your idea is actually good BEFORE you spend a lot of time building it. Like sketching your art project before painting.

---

### Delivery
**Complex:** The process of building, testing, and deploying solutions to customers.

**Simple:** Actually building the thing and getting it to people who use it.

---

### Technical Debt
**Complex:** The accumulated cost of shortcuts and suboptimal technical decisions that slow future development.

**Simple:** Messy code is like a messy room. The longer you ignore it, the harder it is to clean up—and the harder it is to find anything.

---

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
**Complex:** The smallest product increment that validates a hypothesis with real users.

**Simple:** The simplest version that actually works and teaches you something. A skateboard is an MVP for transportation—not a car without wheels.

---

### Stakeholder
**Complex:** Business partners with vested interest in product outcomes.

**Simple:** People who care about what you're building—like your teacher, parents, or friends who will use what you make.

---

### Product-Market Fit
**Complex:** The degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand.

**Simple:** When people REALLY want what you made—not just "it's okay," but "I need this!" Like when you make the best chocolate chip cookies and everyone keeps asking for more.

---

### Transformation
**Complex:** Organizational change from traditional feature-team model to empowered product teams.

**Simple:** Changing how a whole company works—like a school switching from "teacher tells you everything" to "students work together to figure things out."
